# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 - Pandas and Matplotlib using Jupyter Notebook

## Overview of Project
A fictional company called "PyBer" is exploring the relationship between type of city (Urban, Suburban, Rural) and ride sharing data such as number of rides, drivers and amount of fares.  Using Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, this project visualizes the ride share data across the three city types.  This analysis purportedly will be used to address disparities among the city types so that management can make improvements to ridesharing in underserved neighborhoods.

## Analysis 
### Results
Combining two .csv files containing ride data and city information, a dataframe is created to summararize the differences in ride-sharing data among Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types.
